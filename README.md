# Data Cleaning in Python with Pandas and MySQL Using SQLAlchemy and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

This project demonstrates data cleaning in Python using the Pandas library, with a connection to a MySQL database through SQLAlchemy. It leverages Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in MySQL for efficient query execution and data manipulation.

---

## Questions Addressed:
1. Find the top 10 highest revenue-generating products.  
2. Find the top 5 highest-selling products in each region.  
3. Compare month-over-month growth for 2022 and 2023 sales (e.g., January 2022 vs. January 2023).  
4. Identify the month with the highest sales for each category.  
5. Determine which subcategory had the highest profit growth in 2023 compared to 2022.

## Key Steps:
### 1. Connect to the MySQL Database  
Use SQLAlchemy to create a connection to the MySQL database, making it easier to manipulate and store data.  
```python
import sqlalchemy as sal

engine = sal.create_engine('mysql+pymysql://root:abhilead@localhost:3306/sys')
conn = engine.connect()
df.to_sql('df_orders', con=conn, index=False, if_exists='append')
```

### 2. Perform Data Cleaning in Pandas  
- Handle missing values.  
- Remove duplicates.  
- Standardize data formats (e.g., dates, currency).  

### 3. Use MySQL Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
CTEs enable complex and reusable SQL queries for:  
- Aggregating sales and revenue.  
- Calculating growth trends and comparisons.  
- Identifying top-performing categories, subcategories, and products.

## Why This Approach?  
Combining Python for data processing and MySQL for structured querying provides a robust and efficient solution for complex data analysis workflows. By leveraging CTEs, SQL queries remain modular and easier to maintain.
